## Developing
ZarrDAP is composed of a frontend UI and four APIs. The APIs are documented at the `/zarrdap/docs` endpoint.

### Catalog
>`/zarrdap/catalog`
>`/zarrdap/api/catalog`

An **HTML catalog** provides a discovery UI for datasets in S3. HTML templates are developed in `app/templates`, and the routing is defined in `app/routes/views.py`.

A **Search API** returns a list of datasets that match *keyword* or *filetype* parameters. The API is developed in `app/api_catalog/catalog.py`.

### OPeNDAP
>`/zarrdap/api/dap2`

DAP2-compliant **DAS**, **DDS**, and **DODS** URLs are available for OPeNDAP connectivity. Use the **DAP URL** with your favorite OPeNDAP client to get started. DAP2 calculations are performed in `app/api_dap2/backend.py` and routing in `app/api_dap2/dap2.py`.

### NetCDF Subsetting
>`/zarrdap/api/ncss`

Retrieve subsets of data files in NetCDF or CSV format . Subsetting calculations are performed in `app/api_dap2/backend.py` and routing in `app/api_dap2/ncss.py`.

### Intake
>`/zarrdap/api/intake`

An **Intake** catalog is automatically generated from the ZarrDAP catalog.
